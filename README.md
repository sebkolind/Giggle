# Giggle

A json to html library.

## Why?

I love native browser technologies.

Being able to generate a full web page from json is super powerful. The benefit of being able to save the json anywhere, like in any database supporting json, opens up a lot of possibilities. It's easy to share between different systems, everybody understands json... The list is long :)

Giggle is built with a mindset of being part of a composition based structure. Meaning that in it self it might not give a lot of value in the modern era, but together with other tools it is very powerful.

## Friends

I will be building other tools that can be used together with Giggle:

- [A low-key reactivity JS library](https://github.com/sebkolind/praxy)
- A simple editor to edit json files used with Giggle
